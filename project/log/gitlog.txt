               - We have found incorrect logic during tokenizing but already solved
               Note:
               - For job's machine, I compile like this "g++ ../readlog/read_log.cpp extractor.cpp extractor_main.cpp -o extractor"
               - The output is a vector which contain "extractor" object

               - We have found with incorrect logic while doing unit test. It did not produce proper result in the first time
                 So, we change syntax like a BOOST_ASSERT and assert and now, It's work
    
               Note:
               - For job's machine, when i gonna compile the unit test I use this 'g++ gitLog_test.cpp -o gitLog_test -lboost_filesystem -lboost_system'
                 if you have any problem while compiling unit test, you might try my solution
    
               What we have in unit test
               1. Check 'gitlog.txt' is existed or not
               2. Check 'gitlog.txt' is empty or not (check by file size)

    @comment = This code cannot be used for unit testing since there is no clear function (just only main)
    	   So, we choose to use minimal test for this testing. The error that we've found is in the pair list name.
               - The pair list name alwats begin with comma (",")
    	   - missing return 0;
